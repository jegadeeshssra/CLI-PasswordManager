Building a basic CLI password manager involves several steps and considerations. Below is a list of **requirements** and **specifics** to guide you in creating one.

---

### **Core Features**
1. **Secure Storage**:
   - Store passwords securely using encryption (e.g., AES).
   - Use a master password to derive a key for encryption and decryption.

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Add a new password (e.g., for a website or service).
   - Retrieve a stored password.
   - Update an existing password.
   - Delete a password entry.
   - List all stored services/accounts (without revealing passwords).

3. **User Input**:
   - CLI interface for user interaction.
   - Support for commands like `add`, `get`, `update`, `delete`, and `list`.

---

### **Technical Requirements**
1. **Programming Language**:
   - Python is ideal for its simplicity and robust libraries.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Use a library like `cryptography` or `pycryptodome` for encryption.
   - Encrypt both passwords and metadata (e.g., service names).

3. **Storage**:
   - Use a lightweight database like SQLite for persistent storage.
   - Store encrypted passwords and metadata in the database.

4. **User Authentication**:
   - Require a master password to unlock the password manager.
   - Use PBKDF2 or Argon2 for secure key derivation from the master password.

5. **CLI Framework**:
   - Use libraries like `argparse`, `click`, or `typer` to handle CLI commands and arguments.

---

### **Implementation Steps**
#### 1. **Setup Project Structure**:
   - `password_manager.py`: Main script.
   - `utils/crypto.py`: Functions for encryption and decryption.
   - `data/`: Store the SQLite database (e.g., `passwords.db`).

#### 2. **Master Password and Key Derivation**:
   - Prompt the user to set a master password on the first run.
   - Use `PBKDF2HMAC` (from `cryptography`) to derive a secure encryption key.
   - Store the derived key securely in memory during the session.

#### 3. **Database Schema**:
   - Create a table in SQLite with the following fields:
     - `id` (integer, primary key)
     - `service` (encrypted string)
     - `username` (encrypted string)
     - `password` (encrypted string)
     - `notes` (encrypted string, optional)

#### 4. **Encryption and Decryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields (`service`, `username`, `password`, `notes`) before storing in the database.
   - Decrypt them when retrieved by the user.

#### 5. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Use a CLI framework like `typer`:
     - **Commands**:
       - `add`: Add a new service with username and password.
       - `get`: Retrieve a password for a given service.
       - `update`: Update the password for a service.
       - `delete`: Remove a service from the database.
       - `list`: List all services.

#### 6. **Validation**:
   - Ensure user inputs are sanitized.
   - Prevent duplicate service entries in the database.
   - Validate the master password on startup.

#### 7. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle exceptions like database errors, invalid master password, or decryption failures.
   - Provide user-friendly error messages.

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Initialization**:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py init
   ```
   - Prompts user to set a master password.
   - Creates the database and sets up the encryption key.

2. **Adding a Password**:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py add --service "Gmail" --username "jegadeesh" --password "securepassword123"
   ```
   - Encrypts the data and stores it in the database.

3. **Retrieving a Password**:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py get --service "Gmail"
   ```
   - Decrypts and displays the username and password.

4. **Updating a Password**:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py update --service "Gmail" --password "newsecurepassword456"
   ```

5. **Listing All Services**:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py list
   ```
   - Displays all service names without revealing passwords.

6. **Deleting a Password**:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py delete --service "Gmail"
   ```

### **Security Considerations**
- **Encryption**:
  - Use AES in GCM mode for encryption (ensures data integrity and confidentiality).
- **Key Handling**:
  - Derive the encryption key securely using PBKDF2 or Argon2.
  - Store keys only in memory (never persist them to disk).
- **Master Password**:
  - Hash and store the master password securely using `bcrypt` or `argon2`.
- **Database Security**:
  - Restrict access to the database file using filesystem permissions.

---

### **Tools and Libraries**
1. **Encryption**:
   - `cryptography` (`pip install cryptography`)
2. **Database**:
   - SQLite (built-in with Python's `sqlite3` module).
3. **CLI Framework**:
   - `typer` (`pip install typer`)
4. **Password Hashing**:
   - `bcrypt` (`pip install bcrypt`)

---

### **Project Extension Ideas**
- **Password Generation**:
  - Add a feature to generate strong random passwords.
- **Backup and Restore**:
  - Allow users to export and import encrypted data.
- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - Sync passwords using a cloud-based solution with encryption.

By following this plan, you'll have a fully functional and secure CLI password manager!


Connection Object:
- Represents the session with the database.
- Handles transaction management (commit, rollback).
- Creates the cursor object for executing queries.

Cursor Object:
- Executes SQL commands and fetches query results.
- Operates independently within the context of the connection.
